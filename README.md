It showcases the Algorithm build from scratch of simple machine learning algorithm called linear regresssion. 
It comes under supervised learning model deals with linear data consisting of single independent and dependent features which follows a linear sort of characteristics.
This replicates the scikit learn LinearRegression modal and demonstrates its action.
